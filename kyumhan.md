My name is Kyung Min Han and I go by Kyung. I am currently a senior at UTK majoring in computer science and minoring in cybersecurity and machine learning. I love to play sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball and bowlin
and I like to game as well. In this class, I would like to understand more about analysing big data set in order to apply to my career as well as my hobbies.
